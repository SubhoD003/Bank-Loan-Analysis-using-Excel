# About project

The Bank Loan Analysis project in Excel provides a comprehensive overview of the bank's lending activities, focusing on key performance indicators such as total loan 
applications, funded amounts, and amounts received. This analysis differentiates loans into 'Good' and 'Bad' categories based on their status (e.g., Fully Paid, Current, 
Charged Off), offering a clear picture of the quality of the loan portfolio. Additionally, the project tracks month-to-date (MTD) performance and month-over-month (MoM) 
changes, enabling the bank to monitor loan trends over time. Through various visualizations, including line charts, bar charts, and treemaps, this analysis identifies 
regional patterns, loan purpose breakdowns, and borrower characteristics, helping to inform strategic decisions and improve the bank's lending strategies.
